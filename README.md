========

This is a collection of code I reuse/random coding projects that I do not want to take up a whole repo with

###This repo contains:

2. ApiifyRake -> A rake task that creates an api controller for a rails app
2. CustomRandomRails -> Some code I have used in rails that I haven saved for future use
2. Fault_Finder -> Code that finds syntax errors in code, currently working on Ruby
2. Go_Figure -> Ruby Code to solve a newspaper math puzzle
2. Heorot-JS -> Some JS functions I have written and saved for reuse, but mostly just to explore more about JS
3. Ruby_Battleship -> A Ruby Battleship console game I created long ago and am now rewriting from the ground up with my current knowledge (The new version does not yet work)
4. Ruby_Benchmarker -> A set up Ruby Benchmarking suite
5. Sessrumnir:Ruby_Tools -> Ruby bits of code that I have saved. The code to help with math solutions mostly was inspired by project euler.
6. Sinatra_Rake_File -> A customized Sinatra Rake File (Basic rake experimentation, not touched since before I learned Rails)
7. dotfiles -> A collection of dotfiles including my bash aliases for my local machine and servers
